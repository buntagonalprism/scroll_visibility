# Scroll Visibility

Flutter widget enabling programmatically scrolling specified widgets into view. Helpful for drawing user's attention to fields with errors during input validation or for highlighting interesting content. 

Each widget to be scrolled into view needs a seperate scroll visibility node to identify it so this solution is not intended for scrolling through a large number of items in a ListView (instead consider interacting directly with the scroll controller).
